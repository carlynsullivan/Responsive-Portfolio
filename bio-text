<p>I live and work in Clermont, FL as a Newborn Hearing Screener while attending UCF&#8217;s Coding Bootcamp. I was born and raised in Clermont, went to school at FSU, and lived in California and North Carolina for a number of years before returning to Central Florida. I have been married to Aaron for 7 years as of September 2016 and we have one cat named Jasmine.</p>

			<p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy music, movies, tv, reading, church, food, coffee shops, shopping, trips to the beach, bike riding, Disney and Disney Springs, and honing my web development skills. </p>
